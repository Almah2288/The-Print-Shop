                    <p>So which materials do 3D printers use to print anyhow? This is a common refrain from those unfamiliar with how 3D printers like the HP Metal Jet render physical objects, and even those more familiar with the 3D printing process may be surprised to find out there are other lesser known printing materials, from chemical elements to precious earth metals to commonplace Lego® bricks.</p>

                <p>The average consumer 3D printer costs around $700. The cheapest 3D printers start at around $200. High end consumer 3D printers can cost several thousand dollars.</p>
                <p>The cost of 3D printers has dropped considerably over the past three years. As late as 2014, it was hard to find quality 3D printers for under $2000. Today, numerous high-quality options exist for under $1000.</p>

                <p>Although it originally appeared as though it would be a niche market, 3D printing started to hit the headlines a few years ago, fascinating people all around the world with a visually stunning creation process. Now, it is used everywhere – aerospace, fashion, food, automotive, healthcare… the list goes on. <br>Nowadays, many people even have 3D printers in their homes. We live in times when it has become cheaper, faster and more customisable to 3D print something at home than to find and buy it from a store. </p>

                <p>When 3D printing first arrived, enthusiasts imagined a future of desktop factories where people wouldn’t need to drive out to a store to get things they needed anymore. Instead, they could just download pre-made designs from the internet and print them from the comfort of their own home.</p>
                <p>Modern 3D printers may not be in every household quite yet, but the internet is already filled with millions of ready-to-print objects.  Not all these things are worth the plastic they’re printed from, but some of them are downright genius.</p>
